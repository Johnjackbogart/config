**welcome to my neovim config**

most of this was done with the help of [primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) and [josean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8)

so it is a pretty standard set up.

init.lua is the entry point, where lazy and core options get added to set up
from there, lazy.lua includes all of the necessary plugins
the plugins folder contains some fun stuff, as well as its own init.lua for the basic stuff
aditionally, the plugins folder has an lsp folder for all the fancy lsp stuff
finally, core is where options and keymaps get set

_TODO:_
-get links to all plugins and include here
