**welcome to my neovim config :)**

most of this was done with the help of [primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) and [josean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8)

so it is a pretty standard set up.

init.lua is the entry point, where lazy and core options get added to set up<br>
from there, lazy.lua includes all of the necessary plugins<br>
the plugins folder contains some fun stuff, as well as its own init.lua for the basic stuff<br>
aditionally, the plugins folder has an lsp folder for all the fancy lsp stuff<br>
finally, core is where options and keymaps get set<br>

_TODO:_<br>
-get links to all plugins and include here
